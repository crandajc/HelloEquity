HelloEquity: A new security token type for enterprise ownership

HelloEquity is a new security token type under development that resides on a blockchain and replaces the traditional utility of company stock.  This project develops a new distributed application ("dApp") to tokenize enterprise equity in the form of security tokens.  An enterprise's HelloEquity token (e.g. "IBM.HE") imputes enterprise ownership, distributes dividends, and manages voting rights.  This dApp will be a critical enterprise tool to raise capital without the overhead of traditional 3rd party exchanges and brokerages.  Utilizing the Hedera distributed ledger, HelloEquity tokens will leverage much faster transaction and settlement time, ABFT security, crystal clear transparency, SEC compliance by design, and 24/7 liquidity at a fraction of the cost of traditional exchanges and brokerages. It will also provide a self-adminstrated enterprise trading platform to provide services such as token sale, buy-back, and bridging to DEX for hosting via the Hedera network.
